Module Design Pattern

# Definition
  In JavaScript, a widely used and powerful pattern is the Module Pattern
<ul>
  <li>Breaks up different pieces of codes for easy maintainance</li>
  <li>Helps keep particular pieces of codes independent from each other</li> 
  <li>Helps in writing readable, reusable and maintainable code.</li>  
  <li>The Javascript module pattern enables the implementation of the closure principle providing the control of privacy in your methods so that third party applications   or modules cannot access data in variables or overwrite it.</li>
</ul>

# There are multiple benefits to using module pattern.
  Here are the some of them:
  <b>Maintainability</b> — It helps you maintain your code better. Updating a single module is much easier when the module is separate from other pieces of code.
  <b>Namespacing</b> — It helps us to avoid polluting the global namespace. it’s common to have namespace pollution, where completely unrelated code shares global variables. In the javaScript language, all variables located outside the scope of top-level functions are global. This means that other code can access them. This is problematic because it creates a situation called namespace pollution.
  <b>Reusability</b> — It helps us to reuse code, module that we can reuse over and over again.
  <b>Readability</b> — It helps us to understand code easily.
